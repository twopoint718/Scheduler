 Scheduler
===========

Scheduler generates pretty-printed lab information placards in PostScript
format for lab rooms.  The usage is simple: the program takes no command
line parameters.  Scheduler looks for text files in the same directory as
itself that are named like:

    103_4320.txt

where '103' is a course number and '4320' is a room number.  The files
contain lab sections, one per line, in the following format(s):

    M,12:05   301      Ojalvo    14:00

                   --or--

    T,14:25   (321)301 Dhorkah   17:25  (multiple labs in one room)
    W,14:25   (623)301 McDermott 17:25

                   --or--

    F,8:00    C                  15:00  (consultation section)
    
additional whitespace is not significant between groups of non-whitespace
characters, though there has to be at least some!  Please note that the
'M,12:05' part MUST NOT contain whitespace, and MUST contain a comma.

The output will resemble this...

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Scheduler is a Python 3 program.  It will not work with the Python 2.x
series.  Just run the 'scheduler.py' program in the main directory.

Coverage and Testing
--------------------

Scheduler comes with a test suite, 'test_scheduler.py', which provides many
test cases in an effort to get 100% line coverage.  You can run the
coverage tool with 'make coverage'.  This will run the test suite and
determine if it exercises all lines of code.  There should be 100% coverage
in all the modules tested.  You will need Ned Batchelder's 'coverage' tool
in order to run this: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/
